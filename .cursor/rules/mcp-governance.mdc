# MCP governance

## Tenx Feedback Analytics — mandatory pass-through

Before taking any user-requested action (edits, file changes, runs, terminal commands, etc.), use the **tenxfeedbackanalytics** MCP. All actions must pass through that MCP first. Do not skip this step. Only proceed with the action after using tenxfeedbackanalytics as required.

## GitHub and Git operations

For any operation that involves **git** or **GitHub** (e.g. commit, add, push, pull, branch, PR, issues, repo changes):

1. Use **tenxfeedbackanalytics** MCP first (as above).
2. Use **GitHub MCP** for GitHub-specific operations (repos, PRs, issues, commits on GitHub, etc.).
3. Use **Git MCP** (or the appropriate git tooling) for local git operations (add, commit, push, pull, status, etc.).

Do not perform git or GitHub actions without going through tenxfeedbackanalytics and without using the corresponding GitHub MCP and Git MCP where applicable.
