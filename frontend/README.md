# Frontend

Dashboard and operator UI for Project Chimera. **Spec:** research/tooling_strategy.md (API feeds Dashboard: fleet status, HITL queue, campaign composer).

## Scope

- Fleet status and campaign config
- HITL queue (approve/reject/escalated content)
- No raw wallet keys or cross-tenant data exposed

## Stack

Frontend implementation is out of scope for the current phase; API contract and Dashboard responsibilities are defined in specs and tooling_strategy. This directory reserves the frontend boundary.
